If you require assistance in a language other than English, or special services to accommodate a disability, please select an arbitration forum that can accommodate your needs.<br><br>


      
      <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha">
      <li>The arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral, qualified and competent arbitrator selected by you and us under the rules of the arbitration forum selected. The arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitation, and shall honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The Arbitration shall take place in a location determined by the arbitrator the federal district of your residence.</li>
      
      <li>If you file for arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, the only fee you may required to pay is $200, which is approximately equivalent to current court filing fees. We will bear all other of the arbitration, except for your attorneys' fees and costs. If we file for arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, we will be required to pay all costs associated with the arbitration, except for your attorneys' fees and costs. However, if circumstances relating to the dispute (including, among other things, the size and nature of the dispute, the nature of the services that we have provided you, and your ability to pay) it would be unfair or burdensome for you to pay the arbitration filing fees, we will advance the initial filing, administration, and hearing fees required by the arbitrator, who will ultimately decide who will be responsible for paying those amounts.</li>
      <li>You can participate without representation or may choose to be represented by an attorney or other authorized representative, unless that choice is prohibited by applicable law. Because arbitration is a final, legally-binding process that may impact your legal rights, you may want to consider consulting an attorney. Each party, you and we, shall bear our own costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, that we incur with respect to the arbitration.
</li>
<li>The Arbitrator shall allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute, under the Arbitrator's supervision, prior to the arbitration hearing or submission of written presentations.
</li>
<li>Arbitrations may be decided upon written presentations, unless the amount of relief requested exceeds $25,000. The Arbitrator may consider dispositive motions, but shall generally hold a conference call among all the parties prior to permitting any written motion. The Arbitrator may hold hearings in person or by conference call, and hearings generally will not exceed one day. If you or we show good cause, the arbitrator may schedule additional hearings within seven calendar days after the initial hearing.
</li>


      </ol>
      
      
      </li>
   <li><strong>  Interpretation of this Arbitration Agreement:</strong> Any dispute as to the arbitrability of a claim shall be
      decided by the arbitrator. Any dispute as to the validity of the portion of this agreement that prohibits class
      arbitration shall be a matter for resolution by a court and not by the arbitrator. In the event that the court
      deems the portion of this agreement that prohibits class arbitration to be unenforceable, then the court shall
      retain jurisdiction over the dispute and this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void.</li>   
      
 <li> <strong>  Statutes of Limitations:</strong> All statutes of limitations that are applicable to any claim or dispute shall apply to
      any arbitration between you and us. </li>
      
      
      <li> <strong> Attorneys' Fees:</strong> The arbitrator may, but is not required to, award reasonable expenses and attorneys' fees
      to the prevailing party if allowed by statute or applicable law and by the rules of the arbitration forum.</li>
      
      <li><strong>  Awards:</strong> The Arbitrator shall issue the award in accordance with the rules of the arbitration forum.
      Unless you and we agree otherwise, The award shall provide the concise written reasons for the decision and
      shall apply any identified, pertinent contract terms, statutes and legal precedents. The arbitrator may grant
      any remedy, relief or outcome that you or we parties could have received in court. </li>
      
      <li><strong>  Enforcement of Award:</strong> The award of the arbitrator shall be binding and final after fifteen (15) days have
      passed, and judgment upon the arbitrator's award may thereafter be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</li>
  
      
      <li><strong>  Appeal Procedure:</strong> Within fifteen (15) days after an award by the arbitrator, any party may appeal the
      award by requesting in writing a new arbitration before a panel of three neutral arbitrators designated by the
      same arbitration service. The decision of the panel of three neutral arbitrators will be immediately binding
      and final.</li>
      
      
      <li><strong>  Small Claims Court:</strong> Notwithstanding any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement, either you or
      we shall retain the right to seek adjudication in Small Claims Court of any matter within its jurisdiction. Any
      matter not within the Small Claims Court's jurisdiction shall be resolved by arbitration as provided above.
      Any appeal from a Small Claims Court judgment shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions in Section 8
      of this Arbitration Agreement or applicable law.</li>
      
      <li><strong>  Counterparts:</strong> This Arbitration Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
      each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall be deemed to be one instrument.</li>
